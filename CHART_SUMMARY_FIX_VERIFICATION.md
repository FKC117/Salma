# Chart Summary Parameter Fix Verification

## Issue Description

The error occurred when calling `AnalysisResultManager.create_chart_analysis_result()` with an unexpected keyword argument `chart_summary`. This happened because:

1. The tool executor was adding a `chart_summary` field to the result data
2. This data was being passed to the analysis result manager via `create_analysis_result()`
3. The `create_chart_analysis_result()` method didn't accept a `chart_summary` parameter
4. This caused a "got an unexpected keyword argument" error

## Fix Implementation

I've fixed the issue by modifying the `create_chart_analysis_result()` method in `analysis_result_manager.py`:

### Changes Made

1. **Added `chart_summary` parameter** to the method signature:
   ```python
   def create_chart_analysis_result(
       self,
       analysis_id: str,
       title: str,
       description: str,
       chart_type: str,
       data: Any,
       chart_config: Dict[str, Any] = None,
       chart_insights: List[Dict[str, Any]] = None,
       statistical_summary: Dict[str, Any] = None,
       chart_summary: Dict[str, Any] = None  # Added this parameter
   ) -> str:
   ```

2. **Modified the method to use the provided chart_summary** or create one if not provided:
   ```python
   # Use provided chart_summary or create one
   if chart_summary is None:
       chart_summary = self._create_chart_summary(chart_type, data, chart_data)
   ```

## Verification

The fix has been verified by checking:

1. ✅ The function signature now includes the `chart_summary` parameter
2. ✅ The function correctly uses the provided `chart_summary` or creates one if not provided
3. ✅ The correlation analysis functionality continues to work correctly

## Impact

This fix resolves the error and ensures that:

1. Chart analysis results can be created with custom chart summaries
2. The tool executor can pass chart summary data without errors
3. The analysis result manager properly handles both provided and generated chart summaries
4. All existing functionality continues to work as expected

## Testing

The correlation analysis tools have been tested and verified to work correctly with this fix. The tools are now ready to be activated and used in the Django application following the activation instructions provided in `FINAL_ACTIVATION_INSTRUCTIONS.md`.
