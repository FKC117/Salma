# Virtual Environment Activation (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

## Critical Requirement
**ALWAYS activate the virtual environment before executing ANY terminal command.** This is a non-negotiable requirement for this Django project.

## Virtual Environment Location
The virtual environment is located at: `E:\analytical\venv\`

## Activation Commands
- **Windows PowerShell**: `.\\venv\\Scripts\\Activate.ps1`
- **Windows Command Prompt**: `venv\\Scripts\\activate.bat`
- **Linux/Mac**: `source venv/bin/activate`

## Verification
Before running any command, verify the virtual environment is active by checking:
1. Command prompt shows `(venv)` prefix
2. Python path points to venv: `where python` should show `E:\analytical\venv\Scripts\python.exe`

## Examples of Commands That Require Venv
- `python manage.py` commands
- `pip install` commands
- `python -m pytest` commands
- `celery` commands
- Any Python script execution

## Error Prevention
If you attempt to run commands without activating the virtual environment:
- Django settings will not load properly
- Package imports will fail
- Database connections will fail
- The system will not function correctly

## Always Remember
**NEVER run terminal commands without first activating the virtual environment. This is CRITICAL and NON-NEGOTIABLE.**
