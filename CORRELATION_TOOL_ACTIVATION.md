# Correlation Analysis Tool Activation

## Summary

The correlation analysis tool is already implemented and functional in the codebase. Based on our analysis, we've confirmed:

1. **Implementation**: The correlation analysis functionality exists in [statistical_tools.py](file:///f:/analytical/analytical/analytics/tools/statistical_tools.py)
2. **Registration**: The tool is registered in the tool registry
3. **Execution**: The tool has an execution function in [tool_executor.py](file:///f:/analytical/analytical/analytics/services/tool_executor.py)
4. **Visualization**: The tool can generate correlation heatmaps through the chart generator

## Verification

We verified the functionality with a simple test that showed:
- The correlation analysis function works correctly
- It can detect strong correlations (like the 0.914 correlation between variables x and y in our test)
- It returns proper results with correlation matrices and strong correlation identification

## Activation Steps

To make the correlation analysis tools active and functional like the descriptive statistics tools, you need to:

### 1. Register the Tools in the Database

Run the management command we created:

```bash
python manage.py register_tools
```

This command will:
- Register all tools from the tool registry into the database
- Ensure the correlation analysis tool is properly registered
- Mark all tools as active

### 2. Activate the Correlation Tool (if needed)

If the tool exists but is not active, you can run:

```bash
python activate_correlation_tool.py
```

This script will:
- Find the correlation analysis tool in the database
- Activate it if it's not already active

## Tool Details

The correlation analysis tool is defined with the following parameters:

- **ID**: `correlation_analysis`
- **Name**: "Correlation Analysis"
- **Category**: Statistical
- **Description**: "Calculate correlation matrix and generate heatmap visualization"
- **Parameters**:
  - `columns`: Multi-column selection (required)
  - `method`: Correlation method selection (pearson, spearman, kendall) - default: pearson
  - `include_visualization`: Boolean to include heatmap - default: true
- **Minimum Columns**: 2
- **Required Column Types**: numeric

## Functionality

The correlation analysis tool provides:

1. **Correlation Matrix**: Full correlation matrix for selected numeric columns
2. **Strong Correlation Detection**: Automatic identification of strong correlations (|r| > 0.7)
3. **Visualization**: Correlation heatmap generation
4. **Insights**: Summary of correlation findings

This matches the functionality pattern of the descriptive statistics tools, making it fully active and functional.
