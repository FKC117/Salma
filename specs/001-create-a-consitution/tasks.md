## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   ‚Üí If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   ‚Üí Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   ‚Üí data-model.md: Extract entities ‚Üí model tasks
   ‚Üí contracts/: Each file ‚Üí contract test task
   ‚Üí research.md: Extract decisions ‚Üí setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   ‚Üí Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   ‚Üí Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   ‚Üí Core: models, services, CLI commands
   ‚Üí Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   ‚Üí Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   ‚Üí Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   ‚Üí Same file = sequential (no [P])
   ‚Üí Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   ‚Üí All contracts have tests?
   ‚Üí All entities have models?
   ‚Üí All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

```bash
# Launch T115-T119 together (all independent test files):
Task: "Unit tests for all models in tests/unit/test_models.py"
Task: "Unit tests for all services in tests/unit/test_services.py"
Task: "Unit tests for all tools in tests/unit/test_tools.py"
Task: "Unit tests for security components in tests/unit/test_security.py"
Task: "Unit tests for Celery tasks in tests/unit/test_tasks.py"
```

## Notes
- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies
- **Verify tests fail** before implementing (TDD principle)
- **Commit after each task** for version control
- **Virtual environment MUST be activated** for all Python operations (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **PostgreSQL database** must be running with analytical/postgres/Afroafri117!@ credentials
- **Redis server** must be running for caching and Celery broker
- **Avoid**: vague tasks, same file conflicts, skipping tests

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file ‚Üí contract test task [P]
   - Each endpoint ‚Üí implementation task
   
2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity ‚Üí model creation task [P]
   - Relationships ‚Üí service layer tasks
   
3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each story ‚Üí integration test [P]
   - Quickstart scenarios ‚Üí validation tasks

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup ‚Üí Tests ‚Üí Models ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Endpoints ‚Üí Frontend ‚Üí Celery ‚Üí Integration ‚Üí Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution

## Validation Checklist

- [x] Parallel tasks truly independent (marked [P])
- [x] Each task specifies exact file path
- [x] No task modifies same file as another [P] task

- [x] Audit trail implementation included (T017, T033, T047, T105)
- [x] HTMX error prevention included (T009, T024, T066-T087)
- [x] Performance optimization included (T110-T114, T125-T129)
- [x] Security implementation included (T104-T109)

## üéâ **MAJOR MILESTONE ACHIEVED!**

### ‚úÖ **Frontend Implementation COMPLETED (100%)**
- **Three-Panel UI Layout**: Complete with dark theme, CSS Grid, and draggable resizing
- **File Upload Interface**: Full HTMX integration with progress indicators and validation
- **Analysis Interface**: Dynamic parameter modals, results display, visualizations, and history
- **AI Chat Interface**: Real-time messaging, LLM response formatting, and content display
- **Agentic AI Interface**: Analyze button, progress tracking, controls, and status updates

### üöÄ **Next Phase: Celery Integration & Background Tasks**
The frontend is now complete and ready for Celery task integration to handle background processing, analysis execution, and real-time updates.
