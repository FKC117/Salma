## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Load plan.md from feature directory
   ‚Üí If not found: ERROR "No implementation plan found"
   ‚Üí Extract: tech stack, libraries, structure
2. Load optional design documents:
   ‚Üí data-model.md: Extract entities ‚Üí model tasks
   ‚Üí contracts/: Each file ‚Üí contract test task
   ‚Üí research.md: Extract decisions ‚Üí setup tasks
3. Generate tasks by category:
   ‚Üí Setup: project init, dependencies, linting
   ‚Üí Tests: contract tests, integration tests
   ‚Üí Core: models, services, CLI commands
   ‚Üí Integration: DB, middleware, logging
   ‚Üí Polish: unit tests, performance, docs
4. Apply task rules:
   ‚Üí Different files = mark [P] for parallel
   ‚Üí Same file = sequential (no [P])
   ‚Üí Tests before implementation (TDD)
5. Number tasks sequentially (T001, T002...)
6. Generate dependency graph
7. Create parallel execution examples
8. Validate task completeness:
   ‚Üí All contracts have tests?
   ‚Üí All entities have models?
   ‚Üí All endpoints implemented?
9. Return: SUCCESS (tasks ready for execution)
```

## Notes
- **[P] tasks** = different files, no dependencies
- **Verify tests fail** before implementing (TDD principle)
- **Commit after each task** for version control
- **Virtual environment MUST be activated** for all Python operations (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
- **PostgreSQL database** must be running with analytical/postgres/Afroafri117!@ credentials
- **Redis server** must be running for caching and Celery broker
- **Avoid**: vague tasks, same file conflicts, skipping tests

## Task Generation Rules
*Applied during main() execution*

1. **From Contracts**:
   - Each contract file ‚Üí contract test task [P]
   - Each endpoint ‚Üí implementation task
   
2. **From Data Model**:
   - Each entity ‚Üí model creation task [P]
   - Relationships ‚Üí service layer tasks
   
3. **From User Stories**:
   - Each story ‚Üí integration test [P]
   - Quickstart scenarios ‚Üí validation tasks

4. **Ordering**:
   - Setup ‚Üí Tests ‚Üí Models ‚Üí Services ‚Üí Endpoints ‚Üí Frontend ‚Üí Celery ‚Üí Integration ‚Üí Polish
   - Dependencies block parallel execution
