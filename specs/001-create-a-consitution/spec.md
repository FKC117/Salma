# Feature Specification: Django HTMX Constitution File

**Feature Branch**: `001-create-a-consitution`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "create a consitution file for a project that will run on django and htmx. front end colour scheme shall be dark theme. right now for development we will use default database. no .env file. all in the settings.py. security should be top notch. remember to work on htmx instead of javascript. all designs shall be eye soothing and dark theme. it will be a card basis. simple but beautiful."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a developer, I want a comprehensive constitution file that establishes the foundational rules, standards, and guidelines for a Django + HTMX project, so that all team members understand the project's architecture, design principles, and development practices.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** a new Django + HTMX project is being initialized, **When** I read the constitution file, **Then** I understand the project's technology stack, design principles, and development standards
2. **Given** I am implementing frontend components, **When** I follow the constitution guidelines, **Then** all UI elements follow the dark theme card-based design system
3. **Given** I am configuring security settings, **When** I implement the constitution's security requirements, **Then** the application meets top-notch security standards
4. **Given** I am developing interactive features, **When** I use HTMX instead of JavaScript, **Then** the application maintains the specified technology constraints
5. **Given** I am setting up the development environment, **When** I configure the project according to the constitution, **Then** the setup uses default database and settings.py configuration without .env files

### Edge Cases
- What happens when security requirements conflict with development speed?
- How does the system handle different screen sizes while maintaining the card-based design?
- What are the fallback behaviors when HTMX features are not supported?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: Constitution file MUST define Django as the backend framework with HTMX for frontend interactions
- **FR-002**: Constitution file MUST specify dark theme as the mandatory color scheme for all UI components
- **FR-003**: Constitution file MUST establish card-based design as the primary UI pattern for all pages and components
- **FR-004**: Constitution file MUST define top-notch security standards and implementation guidelines
- **FR-005**: Constitution file MUST prohibit the use of JavaScript in favor of HTMX for all interactive features
- **FR-006**: Constitution file MUST specify development database configuration using Django's default database without .env files
- **FR-007**: Constitution file MUST require all settings to be configured in settings.py file
- **FR-008**: Constitution file MUST establish eye-soothing design principles for the dark theme
- **FR-009**: Constitution file MUST define simple but beautiful design standards for all UI elements
- **FR-010**: Constitution file MUST specify Bootstrap as the CSS framework for styling [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: user mentioned Bootstrap preference in memories but not in current request]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Constitution Document**: A comprehensive guide containing project standards, technology stack, design principles, security requirements, and development guidelines
- **Design System**: A collection of UI patterns, color schemes, and component standards based on dark theme and card-based layouts
- **Security Standards**: A set of security requirements and best practices for Django application development
- **Development Environment**: Configuration standards for Django project setup including database, settings, and deployment requirements
