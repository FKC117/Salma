# Feature Specification: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) System with Redis Vector Database

**Feature Branch**: `rag-integration`  
**Created**: 2024-12-19  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User request to integrate RAG system using Redis as vector database to ground agent outputs in real facts and reduce hallucinations

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a data analyst using the analytical platform, I want the AI agent to provide more accurate analysis plans and explanations by referencing historical analysis patterns and dataset insights, so that I can trust the agent's recommendations and get better analysis results.

### Secondary User Stories
1. **Dataset-Aware Intelligence**: As a user, I want the agent to understand my dataset's characteristics and suggest relevant analysis tools based on similar datasets, so that I get more targeted and effective analysis recommendations.

2. **Cross-Session Learning**: As a user, I want the agent to learn from my previous analysis sessions and apply those insights to new datasets, so that I don't have to repeat the same analysis steps and can build upon past work.

3. **Tool Documentation Retrieval**: As a user, I want the agent to access comprehensive tool documentation and usage examples when planning analysis, so that tool parameters are correctly configured and analysis results are more reliable.

4. **Contextual Explanations**: As a user, I want the agent to provide explanations that reference specific data patterns and analysis results from my datasets, so that I can understand the reasoning behind recommendations.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I upload a new dataset, **When** I ask the agent to analyze it, **Then** the agent retrieves relevant patterns from similar datasets and suggests appropriate analysis tools
2. **Given** I have previous analysis results in the system, **When** I start a new analysis session, **Then** the agent references relevant historical insights in its planning
3. **Given** the agent is planning analysis steps, **When** it needs tool documentation, **Then** it retrieves relevant usage examples and parameter guidelines from the knowledge base
4. **Given** the agent generates analysis results, **When** it explains the findings, **Then** it references specific data patterns and historical context to ground the explanations
5. **Given** I ask questions about my analysis, **When** the agent responds, **Then** it provides answers based on retrieved knowledge rather than generating potentially inaccurate information

### Edge Cases
- What happens when no relevant historical data exists for a new dataset?
- How does the system handle conflicting information from different sources?
- What occurs when Redis is unavailable for vector search?
- How does the system maintain data privacy when indexing analysis results?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### RAG Infrastructure
- **FR-001**: System MUST implement Redis as the vector database for storing and retrieving embeddings
- **FR-002**: System MUST use 'analytical:rag:' key prefix for all RAG-related Redis keys
- **FR-003**: System MUST implement VectorNote model to store embeddings, metadata, and content
- **FR-004**: System MUST support both dataset-aware and global knowledge indexing
- **FR-005**: System MUST implement semantic search using cosine similarity for vector retrieval

#### Dataset-Aware Indexing
- **FR-006**: System MUST automatically index dataset metadata (column types, data quality, statistics) after upload
- **FR-007**: System MUST index analysis result summaries and key findings after each analysis completion
- **FR-008**: System MUST index data quality insights and patterns for future reference
- **FR-009**: System MUST filter all dataset-aware queries by dataset_id and user_id for multi-tenancy

#### Global Knowledge Indexing
- **FR-010**: System MUST index AnalysisTool documentation and parameter schemas
- **FR-011**: System MUST index common error patterns and their solutions
- **FR-012**: System MUST index successful analysis workflows and best practices
- **FR-013**: System MUST index anonymized analysis patterns for cross-dataset learning

#### Agent Integration
- **FR-014**: System MUST integrate RAG retrieval into agent planning phase before generating analysis plans
- **FR-015**: System MUST integrate RAG retrieval into agent execution phase for tool selection and parameter configuration
- **FR-016**: System MUST include retrieved RAG content in LLM context for more informed responses
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide RAG search results as citations in agent explanations

#### Security and Privacy
- **FR-018**: System MUST implement PII masking for all indexed content to protect sensitive data
- **FR-019**: System MUST enforce multi-tenancy with strict dataset_id filtering for all queries
- **FR-020**: System MUST log all RAG queries in audit trail with correlation IDs
- **FR-021**: System MUST track RAG token usage in existing token management system

#### Performance and Reliability
- **FR-022**: System MUST implement caching for frequently accessed RAG content
- **FR-023**: System MUST handle Redis unavailability gracefully with fallback to basic agent operation
- **FR-024**: System MUST optimize vector search performance for sub-second response times
- **FR-025**: System MUST implement incremental indexing to avoid re-processing existing content

### Non-Functional Requirements
- **NFR-001**: RAG search responses MUST be returned within 500ms for optimal user experience
- **NFR-002**: Vector database MUST support at least 10,000 embeddings per user
- **NFR-003**: System MUST maintain 99.9% uptime for RAG functionality
- **NFR-004**: RAG integration MUST not increase overall agent response time by more than 20%

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **VectorNote**: Stores embeddings, metadata, and content for RAG retrieval
- **RAGQuery**: Represents a search query with scope, filters, and results
- **Embedding**: Vector representation of text content for semantic search
- **KnowledgeBase**: Collection of indexed content organized by scope (dataset/global)
- **RAGContext**: Retrieved information integrated into agent decision-making
