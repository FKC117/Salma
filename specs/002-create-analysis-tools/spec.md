# Feature Specification: Analysis Tools Modal System

**Feature Branch**: `002-create-analysis-tools`  
**Created**: 2024-12-28  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "Create analysis tools modal system with backend-driven tool configuration, HTMX-powered tool execution, and integrated analysis result display using our new analysis result templates. The system should allow users to select analysis tools from a modal, configure tool parameters, execute analysis, and display results in text, table, or chart formats with AI interpretation capabilities."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a data analyst, I want to access analysis tools through a modal interface so that I can easily select, configure, and execute various statistical and visualization tools on my dataset, then view the results in a consistent, professional format with AI-powered insights.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have a dataset loaded in my analysis session, **When** I click the "Analysis Tools" button, **Then** a modal should open showing available analysis tools organized by category
2. **Given** I have the analysis tools modal open, **When** I select a specific tool (e.g., "Correlation Analysis"), **Then** I should see a configuration form with relevant parameters for that tool
3. **Given** I have configured a tool with parameters, **When** I click "Execute Analysis", **Then** the tool should run in the background and display a loading state
4. **Given** an analysis has completed successfully, **When** the results are ready, **Then** they should be displayed in the appropriate result template (text, table, or chart) with AI interpretation available
5. **Given** I want to understand my analysis results better, **When** I click "Interpret with AI", **Then** I should receive AI-generated insights and recommendations about the analysis

### Edge Cases
- What happens when a tool execution fails or times out?
- How does the system handle tools that require specific column types that aren't available?
- What happens when a user tries to run multiple analyses simultaneously?
- How does the system handle very large datasets that might cause performance issues?
- What happens when AI interpretation service is unavailable?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a modal interface for accessing analysis tools
- **FR-002**: System MUST organize tools by categories (Statistical, Visualization, Machine Learning, etc.)
- **FR-003**: System MUST display tool descriptions and parameter requirements before execution
- **FR-004**: System MUST validate tool parameters against current dataset column types
- **FR-005**: System MUST execute tools asynchronously with progress indicators
- **FR-006**: System MUST display results using appropriate templates (text, table, chart)
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide AI interpretation for all analysis results
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow users to copy, download, and export analysis results
- **FR-009**: System MUST preserve analysis results in the current session
- **FR-010**: System MUST handle tool execution errors gracefully with user-friendly messages
- **FR-011**: System MUST support tool parameter validation and real-time feedback
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide tool execution history and ability to re-run analyses
- **FR-013**: System MUST integrate with existing dataset switching functionality
- **FR-014**: System MUST respect user token limits for AI interpretation features
- **FR-015**: System MUST provide tool-specific help and documentation

*Example of marking unclear requirements:*
- **FR-016**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: how many concurrent tool executions should be allowed?]
- **FR-017**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: what specific tool categories should be included?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Analysis Tool**: Represents a specific analysis capability with parameters, requirements, and execution logic
- **Tool Category**: Groups related analysis tools (Statistical, Visualization, ML, etc.)
- **Tool Execution**: Tracks individual tool runs with parameters, results, and metadata
- **Analysis Result**: Contains the output of tool execution in text, table, or chart format
- **Tool Configuration**: Stores user-defined parameters for specific tool executions
