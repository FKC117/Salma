# Feature Specification: Sandbox UI with LLM Integration

**Feature Branch**: `003-now-lets-make`  
**Created**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "now lets make our sandbox ui and connect everything with our llm. Remember we have to display only results. If you have question please ask and also consult with our other /tasks file and /constitution  files."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a data analyst, I want to interact with an AI-powered sandbox interface where I can ask questions about my datasets and receive intelligent analysis results, so that I can gain insights without manually running analysis tools.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I have uploaded a dataset and am on the dashboard, **When** I type a question in the chat interface like "What are the key trends in this data?", **Then** the AI should analyze the dataset and provide intelligent insights with relevant visualizations
2. **Given** I have analysis results displayed in the dashboard, **When** I ask "Can you explain what this correlation matrix shows?", **Then** the AI should provide a clear interpretation of the analysis results
3. **Given** I am in an active analysis session, **When** I ask "What should I analyze next?", **Then** the AI should suggest relevant next steps based on the current dataset and previous analyses
4. **Given** I have multiple datasets loaded, **When** I ask "Compare the sales data between these datasets", **Then** the AI should provide comparative analysis across the relevant datasets

### Edge Cases
- What happens when the AI cannot understand the user's question? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should it ask for clarification or provide a generic response?]
- How does the system handle requests for analysis on datasets that don't have the required data? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should it suggest alternative analyses or explain limitations?]
- What happens when the user exceeds their token limits during a conversation? [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the conversation be paused, limited, or terminated?]

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a chat interface integrated into the existing three-panel dashboard layout
- **FR-002**: System MUST connect the chat interface to the existing LLM processor service for intelligent responses
- **FR-003**: System MUST display only analysis results in the main dashboard panel, not raw data or intermediate processing steps
- **FR-004**: System MUST allow users to ask questions about their loaded datasets and receive AI-powered analysis
- **FR-005**: System MUST integrate with existing analysis tools to execute suggested analyses automatically
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide context-aware responses based on the current dataset and analysis session
- **FR-007**: System MUST maintain conversation history within the current analysis session
- **FR-008**: System MUST respect existing token limits and user authentication requirements
- **FR-009**: System MUST display analysis results in the existing card-based UI format
- **FR-010**: System MUST integrate with the existing RAG system for grounded responses

*Requirements needing clarification:*
- **FR-011**: System MUST handle [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: What types of questions should the AI be able to answer - only data analysis questions or general questions about the system?]
- **FR-012**: System MUST provide [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the AI be able to suggest new datasets to upload or only work with existing ones?]
- **FR-013**: System MUST support [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: Should the AI be able to modify analysis parameters or only suggest them?]

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*
- **Chat Interface**: Interactive text input/output component integrated into the existing dashboard
- **LLM Integration**: Connection between chat interface and existing LLM processor service
- **Analysis Results Display**: Card-based presentation of AI-suggested and executed analyses
- **Conversation Context**: Session-specific chat history and dataset context for AI responses
