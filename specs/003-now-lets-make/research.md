# Research: Sandbox UI with LLM Integration

**Feature**: 003-now-lets-make  
**Date**: 2025-09-29  
**Status**: Complete

## Research Tasks Executed

### 1. HTMX Chat Interface Patterns for Django Applications

**Decision**: Use HTMX for real-time chat with server-side rendering
**Rationale**: 
- Maintains consistency with existing HTMX-first architecture
- Leverages existing Django template system
- Provides seamless integration with current dashboard layout
- Enables progressive enhancement without JavaScript

**Alternatives considered**:
- WebSocket implementation: Rejected due to complexity and JavaScript requirement
- Polling-based updates: Rejected due to performance concerns
- Server-Sent Events: Rejected due to limited browser support

**Implementation approach**:
- Use HTMX `hx-post` for message sending
- Use HTMX `hx-trigger` for auto-refresh of chat history
- Implement server-side chat message rendering in Django templates
- Use HTMX `hx-target` to update specific chat container

### 2. LLM Response Integration with Existing UI Components

**Decision**: Integrate LLM responses with existing analysis result display system
**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing card-based UI components
- Maintains consistency with current analysis result presentation
- Reuses existing analysis result templates and formatting
- Provides seamless transition between manual and AI-driven analysis

**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate chat-only interface: Rejected due to context loss
- Plain text responses: Rejected due to poor user experience
- Custom response formatting: Rejected due to maintenance overhead

**Implementation approach**:
- Parse LLM responses to identify analysis suggestions
- Trigger existing analysis tools based on AI recommendations
- Display results using existing analysis result cards
- Integrate with existing analysis history system

### 3. Context Management for AI Chat in Data Analysis Applications

**Decision**: Use existing AnalysisSession and RAG system for context management
**Rationale**:
- Leverages existing session management infrastructure
- Integrates with current dataset switching functionality
- Utilizes existing RAG system for intelligent context retrieval
- Maintains consistency with current analysis workflow

**Alternatives considered**:
- Separate chat context system: Rejected due to duplication
- Simple conversation history: Rejected due to lack of dataset awareness
- Manual context passing: Rejected due to complexity

**Implementation approach**:
- Extend existing ChatMessage model to include analysis context
- Use existing RAG service for dataset-aware context retrieval
- Integrate with existing AnalysisSession for conversation continuity
- Leverage existing token management for context limits

### 4. Analysis Result Display in Chat Interfaces

**Decision**: Use existing analysis result card system with chat integration
**Rationale**:
- Maintains visual consistency with existing dashboard
- Leverages existing analysis result formatting and display logic
- Provides familiar user experience for analysis results
- Enables seamless integration with analysis history

**Alternatives considered**:
- Inline result display: Rejected due to space constraints
- Modal-based results: Rejected due to context switching
- Separate results panel: Rejected due to layout complexity

**Implementation approach**:
- Display analysis results in main dashboard panel using existing cards
- Use HTMX to update results panel from chat interactions
- Maintain existing analysis result templates and styling
- Integrate with existing analysis history and session management

## Technical Decisions Summary

### Chat Interface Architecture
- **Pattern**: HTMX-based chat with server-side rendering
- **Integration**: Seamless integration with existing three-panel layout
- **Updates**: Real-time updates using HTMX triggers and targets
- **Styling**: Consistent with existing dark theme and card-based design

### LLM Integration Strategy
- **Service**: Leverage existing LLMProcessor service
- **Context**: Use existing RAG system for intelligent context retrieval
- **Token Management**: Integrate with existing token tracking and limits
- **Response Format**: Parse and integrate with existing analysis result system

### Context Management Approach
- **Sessions**: Use existing AnalysisSession for conversation continuity
- **Datasets**: Integrate with existing dataset switching functionality
- **History**: Leverage existing analysis history and chat message storage
- **RAG**: Utilize existing Redis-based RAG system for context retrieval

### UI/UX Integration
- **Layout**: Integrate chat into existing right panel of three-panel layout
- **Results**: Display analysis results in existing main panel using card format
- **Navigation**: Maintain existing dataset switching and session management
- **Consistency**: Follow existing dark theme and Bootstrap styling patterns

## Implementation Readiness

All technical unknowns have been resolved:
- ✅ Chat interface patterns defined
- ✅ LLM integration approach clarified
- ✅ Context management strategy established
- ✅ UI integration patterns determined

**Next Phase**: Ready for design and contract generation
